h1. ActiveHelper

_Finally - helpers with proper encapsulation, delegation, interfaces and inheritance!_


h2. Introduction

Helpers suck. They have been always sucking, and they will suck on if we keep them in modules.

ActiveHelper is an attempt to pack helpers into classes. This brings us a few benefits

* *inheritance* helpers can be derived from more abstract helpers
* *delegation* helpers are no longer mixed into a target- the target class @uses@ the helper, where the new 
methods are _delegated_ to the helper class
* *proper encapsulation* blindly mixin' in pollutes the target, whereas delegation doesn't 
* *interfaces* a helper clearly @provides@ methods and eventually @uses@ additional helpers
